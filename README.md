# Endfire-weighted Loss for IPDnet
## üîç Overview
- This study proposes a lightweight LSTM-based neural network for localizing multiple moving sources in noisy and reverberant environment
- A full-band and narrow-band fusion network is adopted as the backbone netowrk, which has recently emerged as a prominant research trend. 
<br>


## üí° Motivation
- The backbone network requires high computational complexity as each individual narrow-band layer must processes full time frames across every frequency bin, resulting in substantial computational burden.
- While the parameter size in a deep-learning model primarily affects memory usage, the actual inference time and energy consumption are more significantly influenced by computational complexity.
- Reducing computational load enhances execution speed and reduces power consumption, making the model more suitable for mobile and embedded environments.
- Therefore, this work focuses on minimizing computational complexity rather than simply reducing parameter size.
<br>


## ‚≠ê Method
- To improve computational efficiency, the model incorporates down-sampling blocks composed of convolutional layers. These progressively compress the temporal dimension while extracting compact feature representations.
- The original skip connection method based on concatenation is replaced with summation to further reduce computation.
